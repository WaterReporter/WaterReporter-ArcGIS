## Functionality

* Popups. Implement all fields for all popups [e.g., Pollution, Activity, Recreational, Access, Watershed]
* Curated Map. The main "Map" should be a curated map, not the same map that is used to add features to the pollution and activity feature services [e.g., a2d34296ca3a4966a924ffd7bad5149a]
* Curated Map. Should auto-zoom to about 10 or 12 when the app loads into the users current location.
* Sketch Map. The Sketch Map should simply load a baseman into the map area and shouldn't use the curated map nor the live map.
* Sketch Map. Should auto-zoom to about 15 when the user selects to update their location.
* What are some of the outstanding bugs we know of?
** Ensure the "Add Report" button works from the main screen
** No option to use photo library and ensure a warning that you are accessing the users photo library is displayed
** No "Question Mark" icon on the "Review tutorialâ€¦ Remove that button completely actually, we don't need it because of the new workflow.
* Ensure that new workflow is completely implemented and bug free.

## Design
* Ensure the buttons use the branded appearance of the application
* Update the appearance of the form labels
* Add grid lines between form fields
* Change "New report" label to be type-specific
* Update the text and images of the Tutorial slides
** Ensure that the slides are positioned properly, because we have changed the format in which they appear (e.g., added a nav bar, removed on-slide buttons, shifted entire slideshow)
** Weird, bouncy scrolling
